# Machine_learning_Project

This project is a Machine learning system who compare a 3 machine learning algorithms for Gender Recognition by Voice. 
The algorithms are: Random forest, Neural network and Kmeans. 
First the system display scatter plots and histograms for feature description and Data understanding. 
The machine learning algorithms applied on 3 different combination of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction data: 
all data, data after Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and data after Backward/Forward selection. 
The Random Forest model builted by 10 Folds cross-validation and present the best prediction. 
The Neural Network builted with 1 hidden layer, and 3 hidden layers with the best number of neurons. 
The K mean model has 2 different variation- with all the data set (without the labels), and with separate unsupervise dataset  for male and female.
